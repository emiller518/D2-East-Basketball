This Django site is a work in progress, combining all resources from other parts of this repository.

My ultimate goal is to create a platform similar to basketball-reference for the east region of Division 2.

In the immediate future, I would like to be able to bring some of the utilities seen here to coaches and players to use for the upcoming season, especially the scouting report utility. More to come as each bit of functionality is added.
